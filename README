This is a ChatGPT based chat bot intended to be used to practice Chinese.
It supports text and audio output and responds to text input.
It also supports translation of the output to pinyin and English.
Practicing listening to Chinese is the primary goal of this bot.
It is currently hardwired to my specific needs (traditional characters and my known vocabulary).
